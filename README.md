# Time Usage Efficiency Calculator

This is personal project that I use to calculate the efficiency of my time usage
based on a simple method I came up with.

## The time usage method rules
Basically the rule is that if the time used during the day for a particular activity
specified in the table below lies in the corresponding time interval then itâ€™s 
considered that the time usage for that activity is 100% efficient. Otherwise, if 
the time exceeds the upper bound of the interval, then the efficiency is calculated 
as <the time spent>/<the upper bound> * 100%. If the time is less than the lower 
bound in the interval, then the efficiently is calculated as 
<the time spent>/<the lower bound> * 100%.


| Activity | Time |
| --- | --- |
| Sleep | 7-9h |
| Work/Job | 5-6h |
| Computer Science | 1-2h |
| Software Engineering | 2-4h |
| Exercise/Work-out | 20m-60m |
